Celestial Object Detection with AVR microprocessor

This project was developed for the Embedded Systems course of ECE-TUC. An AVR ATmega16L was programmed to control a CCTV base with 2 axis of
rotating (simulating a telescope base). The azimuth and elevation (over time) data is imported into the microcontroller, and the controller 
having an internal clock, points the telescope to the selected object, and then tracks.
